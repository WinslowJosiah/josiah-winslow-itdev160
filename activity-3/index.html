			<p>I, Josiah Winslow, am a hobbyist game developer. Whenever I can, I use the medium of video games to practice my programming skills. Oftentimes this is just for the fun of programming, but I've also made a few games that others have enjoyed playing. Below is a selection of titles that I have programmed for various platforms that I particularly enjoy.</p>

						<p>Welcome to the mystical land of Ancient Egypt! One day, you find yourself lost within a mysterious temple, when you come across a goddess incarnated as a jewel. Your job is to restore the goddess's power by breaking the seals found throughout the temple.</p>
						<p>Based on a Japan-exclusive title for the Famicom, <span class="product-name">Egypt</span> is a fun and engaging puzzle game that you can play on any device. In this game, you control a jewel through a series of ancient Egyptian tombs, and your mission in each level is to match up hieroglyph symbols to make them disappear. You do so by pressing the arrow keys and navigating through the twists and turns of each level. If you happen to step onto an arrow tile, the whole row or column shifts in the direction it's pointing; this will become vital to solving the many challenging rooms.</p>
						<p>This stunning game was created for <a target="_blank" href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-7">GBJAM7</a>, an event for which people were challenged to create a GameBoy-like video game in only seven days. <span class="product-name">Egypt</span> ended up placing 15th overall out of 115 entries. While the game only has four colors, it makes use of them really well to create dazzling visuals that are sure to take you back to the 90s. The simple controls and mechanics will get you hooked, and beating the 114 levels of tile-sliding puzzle fun will keep you entertained for hours.</p>

						<p>The elephant forgot the rest of the levels, but luckily he still has one left! Help him beat it in all his metagaming glory. Use your keen knowledge of gaming and dexterity to manhandle your way through a variety of challenges. Get your mind out of the box for once! Take it outside for a walk, or maybe grab a bite to eat with it. (Oh, and beat the level. There's only one.)</p>
						<p><span class="product-name">This is the Only Level</span> is based on a Flash game by John Cooney, a.k.a. jmtb02. While Flash will sadly be unsupported in all browsers by 2020, this game will be around for as long as you keep around that graphing calculator you used in high school! The controls are simple: most of the functions in the game require the arrow keys. However, anyone who plays this game will quickly figure out that it's not that simple to beat. There is only one "level", but there are in fact many different <em>stages</em> within this one level, each with their own little defining quirks. The challenge for the player is to figure them out, then maneuver the elephant to the end of the stage with these quirks in mind.</p>
						<p>To this day, <span class="product-name">This is the Only Level</span> remains one of my most downloaded programs on TICalc.org, and for good reason. This game is very nostalgic for people who are currently in their high-school level math classes, and its mechanics and surprises are implemented fabulously here. In addition, the game shows you your time at the end of it, encouraging you to play the game again and see if you can go even faster!</p>
